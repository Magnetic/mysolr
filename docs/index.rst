Welcome to mysolr's documentation!
==================================

mysolr was born to be a fast and easy-to-use client for Apache Solr's API and because 
existing Python clients didn't fulfill these conditions.


Basic Usage
-----------
::

    from mysolr import Solr

    # Default connection to localhost:8080
    solr = Solr()

    # All solr params are supported!
    query = {'q' : '*:*', 'facet' : 'true', 'facet.field' : 'foo'}
    response = solr.search(**query)

    # do stuff with documents
    for document in response.documents:
        # modify field 'foo'
        document['foo'] = 'bar'

    # update index with modified documents
    solr.update(response.documents, commit=True)
